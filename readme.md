# Can you say 'Overengineering'?

This is a sample project to illustrate some points: 

* A clean DDD-style architecture
* The use of IoC following the Dependency Inversion principle
* Commit messages
* Unit-Testing and Test-driven development
  * Mocking (using Moq)
  * Building a handy base-class for 99% of your unit-tests (using StructureMap.AutoMocking.Moq)

The app itself is nothing more than a console application as the simplest of apps for illustrating the points above.
